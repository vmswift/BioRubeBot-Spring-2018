IntroLevel1 Changes Spring 2018

Had to update some Assets for the project using:
1.To do this go to the Assets menu at the top. 
2.Import Package
3.Select Package that needs to be updated


Had to Reimport all at one point to fix some build errors
-- option under assets menu


fixed following scripts:
(all changes are indicated in scripts with comments)

ActivateTrigger.cs -- line 7--> ActivateTrigger was changed to 
DoActiveTrigger.(both obj have same parameters)

LoadScene.cs -- line 14-->in the rerstartbutton() method Application.LoadLevel(Application.loadedLevel)
was replaced with SceneManager.LoadScene(homeMenuScene);.
On line 22 --> Application.LoadLevel(nextScene); was replaced with the updated SceneManager.LoadScene(nextScene);
On line 4 -->using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; <-- needed for SceneManager)

AstarUpdateWindow.cs -- added lines 42 and 43 to replace obselete window.title on line 41.
The old window.title received a string type. window.title has been replaced with window.titleContent.
window.titleContent can recieve a GUIContent type which has a constructor to for dynamic creation with string.

NavMeshRenderer.cs -- Line 24 lastLevel is looking for EditorApplication.currentScene to return a string.
EditorApplication.currentScene is obselete, so i replaced it with SceneManager.GetActiveScene.ToString(), which
returns the current scene as a Scene type converted to string for lastlevel. (This could probably be done with 
.name instead of tostring(), which returns a Scene type data field called name. Need to test this.) 
On line 28 EditorApplication.currentScene was replaced with SceneManager.GetActiveScene().ToString(), same
rational as above.
