Steps for Implementing a New Win Condition

1)	Drag “WinCon_Unchecked” prefab (Project > Assets > Prefabs) to appropriate scene (or copy a currently placed WinCon_Unchecked object from an existing level)

2)	Change coordinates (Inspector > Transform > X, Y, Z) to reflect proper location (First WinCon at -60, -45, 0 ; second at x of -53; 3rd at x of -46; etc. as of end of term Summer 2017).

3)	Create a New Tag
	a.	Inspector > Tag > Add Tag… (Bottom)
	b.	Plus sign button (Bottom Right)
	c.	Type descriptive new tag name (Current naming convention is Win_DescriptionOfEvent).
			Note: You may want to copy this name to the clipboard for steps 5 and 6
	d.	Select Save

4)	Reselect WinCon_Unchecked prefab and set the tag to your newly created tag (Inspector > Tag > choose rag from dropdown menu)

5)	Open GameWon.cs file (Project > Assets > Scripts) and add tag to WinConditionTags string array
		Note: This string must be EXACTLY what was added in step 3

6)	Add following line of code to script (Replace “Win_Example” with newly created tag) wherever the new win condition occurs in your code.
	if (GameObject.FindWithTag("Win_Example ")) WinScenario.dropTag("Win_Example ");
		Note: This string must be EXACTLY what was added in step 3
