# BioRubeBot (Development)
This is the git repository for the production version of BioRubeBot.

The master branch in this repository contains the version of the game
as it existed at start of development.   Development MUST occur in the
biorubebot-dev repository - only release branches from that repo and
hotfix branches in this repo should be pushed to the master branch.

At start of a project, developers should pull the current master from
biorubebot-production into the master branch in this repository. At that
time, a new product release branch should be created from the master in
THIS repository.   For example, a "Spring2017" branch should be created
for development started in that semester.

Team members need to create a new branch for each feature that they are
adding or modifying.  When ready to integrate this feature, merge your
work into the product release branch.  Feature branches may be deleted
once one confirms the merge was successful.  Upon completion of the project,
the product release branch should be merged into the master branch.

Upon approval of changes, Prof. Lewis or Prof. Mayfield will merge the
master branch in this repository into a release branch in
biorubebot-production.  Once it's confirmed this is working, that branch
will be merged into the master branch in the production repository.

The Project is currently compiled under Unity Version 5.5.0f3.
